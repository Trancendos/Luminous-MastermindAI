Here’s a focused audit checklist tailored to detect OWASP security issues specifically in AI-generated code, combining classic OWASP best practices with AI-specific risks and verification steps:Audit Checklist for OWASP Issues in AI-Generated Code1. Injection FlawsVerify absence of unsanitized inputs in SQL, NoSQL, OS commands, LDAP, XPath, etc.Check that parameterized queries/prepared statements are used.Flag any string concatenations used to build queries or commands.Validate all user inputs with strict whitelisting and proper escaping.Scan for code injections via eval(), exec(), or similar in dynamic contexts.2. Broken AuthenticationConfirm strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), no plaintext or weak hashes.Ensure multi-factor authentication or equivalent protections are prescribed if relevant.Review session management: secure, HTTPOnly cookies, proper expiration, no token reuse.Check for absence of hardcoded credentials or secrets in code or configs.3. Sensitive Data ExposureEnsure encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest where applicable.Validate that sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages.Confirm use of secrets managers or environment variables rather than in-code secrets.Review data masking or redaction in UI and APIs.4. XML External Entities (XXE)Detect unsafe XML or JSON parsers vulnerable to XXE.Verify secure configurations or use of safe libraries/parsers.5. Broken Access ControlCheck role-based access controls (RBAC) are correctly implemented and enforced.Validate authorization checks occur server-side for all sensitive operations.Detect missing or inconsistent access verifications on APIs and endpoints.6. Security MisconfigurationConfirm secure defaults in configurations (e.g., HTTPS only, CORS policies, content security policy).Scan for debug endpoints, default accounts, or verbose error messages present in prod code.Review third-party dependency usage for outdated versions or known CVEs.7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)Verify proper output encoding/escaping for any untrusted data rendered in HTML, JS, or attributes.Flag use of unsafe inline scripts or eval-like constructs.Confirm Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are defined.8. Insecure DeserializationDetect use of deserialization functions on untrusted data without verification.Verify integrity checks or use safer serialization formats.9. Using Components with Known VulnerabilitiesScan all dependencies via automated tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).Ensure package versions are maintained and updated.10. Insufficient Logging & MonitoringEnsure comprehensive logging is present for authentication, authorization, and sensitive operations.Validate logs avoid sensitive data exposure and integrate with SIEM or alerting tools.AI-Generated Code Specific ChecksPrompt Injection Guarding: Check code generated does not contain backdoors or unexpected eval/execution paths.Deprecated or Unsafe Patterns: Verify no usage of outdated crypto (e.g., MD5, SHA-1), weak ciphers, or deprecated APIs.Hardcoded Credentials: Confirm all secrets removed or replaced with environment/config variables.Error Handling: Ensure generated code includes proper error handling avoiding information leakage.Code Duplication & Complexity: High complexity or copy-paste may hide undocumented security risks; flag for review.Tools and Techniques for AutomationStatic Analysis: SonarQube, CodeQL, Bandit, ESLint security pluginsDependency Scanners: OWASP Dependency-Check, SnykSecurity Linters: Semgrep with OWASP rulesetsRuntime Testing: Fuzzing, penetration testing frameworksProcess RecommendationsAlways conduct manual security review of AI-generated code especially for security-critical modules.Use security-focused prompt engineering to generate code with explicit secure coding instructions.Combine static/dynamic automated scans with human-in-the-loop review to catch semantic or contextual flaws.This checklist aligns core OWASP categories with the nuances and risks introduced by AI code generation and provides a practical framework for securing AI-assisted development workflows. If desired, a detailed concrete checklist in checklist tool format (Excel, JSON) can be drafted.
