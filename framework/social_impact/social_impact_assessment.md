# Social Impact Assessment Framework for Artificial Intelligence

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a framework for assessing and mitigating the social impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Drawing inspiration from established methodologies such as the World Economic Forum's PRISM framework and the ISO/IEC 42005 standard for AI impact assessment, this framework provides a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and addressing the potential societal consequences of AI technologies. The primary objective is to guide the development and deployment of AI in a manner that is both responsible and beneficial to society.

## 2. Core Principles

The social impact assessment process is guided by the following core principles:

- **Human-centricity**: Placing human well-being and societal values at the center of AI development and deployment.
- **Inclusivity**: Engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders, including marginalized and vulnerable communities, to ensure their perspectives are considered.
- **Transparency**: Being open and transparent about the potential impacts of AI systems and the measures being taken to address them.
- **Accountability**: Establishing clear lines of responsibility for the social impact of AI systems.
- **Proportionality**: Ensuring that the measures taken to mitigate negative impacts are proportionate to the scale and severity of the potential harm.

## 3. The PRISM Framework

The PRISM framework, developed by the World Economic Forum, provides a valuable lens through which to view the social impact of AI. It encourages a holistic approach that considers the following dimensions:

- **People**: The impact on individuals, including their rights, well-being, and autonomy.
- **Rights**: The impact on human rights, including privacy, freedom of expression, and non-discrimination.
- **Inclusion**: The impact on social inclusion and equity, ensuring that AI benefits all members of society.
- **Society**: The broader societal impacts, including effects on democracy, social cohesion, and the environment.
- **Market**: The impact on the economy and labor markets, including job displacement and the creation of new opportunities.

## 4. ISO/IEC 42005: AI Impact Assessment

ISO/IEC 42005 provides a standardized framework for conducting AI impact assessments. It emphasizes a lifecycle approach, integrating assessment processes throughout the development and deployment of AI systems. Key components of the ISO/IEC 42005 framework include:

- **Risk Identification and Classification**: Systematically identifying and classifying potential risks across technical, societal, regulatory, and reputational domains.
- **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**: Engaging with all potentially affected parties to understand their concerns and perspectives.
- **Mitigation Strategy Development**: Developing and implementing actionable strategies to mitigate identified risks.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Establishing mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the AI system's impact.

## 5. Social Impact Assessment Process

This framework proposes a four-stage social impact assessment process:

### Stage 1: Scoping and Planning

- **Define the scope**: Clearly define the AI system and its intended purpose.
- **Identify stakeholders**: Identify all individuals and groups who may be affected by the AI system.
- **Develop a plan**: Create a detailed plan for the social impact assessment, including timelines, resources, and responsibilities.

### Stage 2: Impact Analysis

- **Identify potential impacts**: Brainstorm and identify all potential positive and negative social impacts of the AI system, using the PRISM framework as a guide.
- **Analyze the impacts**: Analyze the likelihood and severity of each potential impact, considering both short-term and long-term consequences.
- **Engage with stakeholders**: Conduct consultations with stakeholders to gather their input and feedback on the potential impacts.

### Stage 3: Mitigation and Enhancement

- **Develop mitigation strategies**: For each negative impact, develop strategies to avoid, reduce, or mitigate the harm.
- **Develop enhancement strategies**: For each positive impact, develop strategies to maximize the benefits.
- **Create an action plan**: Develop a detailed action plan for implementing the mitigation and enhancement strategies.

### Stage 4: Monitoring and Review

- **Monitor the impacts**: Continuously monitor the actual impacts of the AI system after deployment.
- **Review the assessment**: Periodically review and update the social impact assessment to reflect any new information or changes in the AI system or its context.

## 6. Conclusion

By following this social impact assessment framework, developers and organizations can take a proactive and responsible approach to the development and deployment of AI systems. This will help to ensure that AI technologies are used in a way that benefits society as a whole, while minimizing the potential for harm.
