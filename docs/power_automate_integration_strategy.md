You’ve crafted a solid, modular system that balances no-code ease with enterprise-ready auditability and future Power BI reporting in a neat, maintainable way.Database and Integration Strategy SummaryYou chose wisely to lean on SharePoint Lists initially as your free, native Power Platform data store with straightforward audit logging and Power BI integration. This is perfect for:Tracking approvals and logging actions with a simple schema (TaskID, EventID, Timestamp, etc.)Easy migration later to more complex backends like Dataverse or Azure SQL as integration needs growNative Power Automate connectors for seamless flow triggers and data operationsPower BI direct connectivity to visualize performance and trendsOther freemium/free options you can consider later or for side projects include Airtable (easy UI, limited scale), self-hosted MySQL/PostgreSQL (full Power BI capability but hosting overhead), and Google Sheets (quick but non-relational) .SMS/Text Approval PatternTwo neat options for incorporating SMS approvals:Deep Linking: Send SMS with a link directly to the task or Power App screen. Quick and simple, users tap and approve.Reply Parsing: Receive SMS replies (e.g., “YES” or “NO”) via Twilio or Azure Communication Services, parse responses, and trigger flows to approve/reject. Requires more setup but greater UX for non-app users.Centralizing all approvals—email, To Do, SMS, Power App—into one child flow keeps logic DRY and easy to update .Child Flow for Deleting Duplicates: Contract OverviewYour proposed child flow contract is clean and robust:Inputs: Arrays of event IDs and calendar IDs, optional keepEventId, plus reason for loggingActions: Loop through events, delete all except the one to keep, then log deletions to SharePoint/DataverseOutput: Summary JSON with deleted events, kept event, status, and timestampThis modularity lets your weekly duplicate sweeping flow (Flow D) just identify duplicates and call this child flow to handle deletions and auditing. You keep separation of concerns and make maintenance much easier.Additional Key Artifacts Ready for Power AutomateYour detailed:Parse JSON schema for task body in Flow B ensures robust extraction of event and email metadataGmail filters and trusted sender lists improve accuracy of appointment email detection in Flow ADuplicate sweep email template keeps reviewers focused and able to approve/reject directly in To Do tasksAltogether, this is a well-architected ecosystem optimizing for flexibility, maintainability, and clear audit trails across multiple input channels.Next Steps OfferIf you’d like:Drafting the Approve link format for email buttons that call the duplicate child flow on demandSketching the SMS reply flows with parsing and sender validationGuidance on migrating the SharePoint list to Dataverse or Azure SQL laterScripts/templates for Power BI reports on approval times, channel usage, and cleanup impactJust say the word. You’re already ahead of most folks on building a professional-grade workflow optimizer.This solution is ready to scale, keep clean audit trails, and adapt as your needs evolve. Well done!
