# Wiki Design Strategy and Structure

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design strategy and structure for the Luminous-MastermindAI wiki. The wiki will serve as a centralized knowledge base for users, developers, and contributors, providing comprehensive information about the framework, its components, and best practices.

## 2. Design Principles

- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Content should be written in clear and concise language, avoiding jargon and unnecessary technical details.
- **Discoverability**: The wiki should be easy to navigate and search, allowing users to find the information they need quickly.
- **Comprehensiveness**: The wiki should cover all aspects of the framework, from high-level concepts to detailed implementation guides.
- **Up-to-Date**: The wiki should be regularly updated to reflect the latest changes and additions to the framework.

## 3. Wiki Structure

The wiki will be organized into the following top-level categories:

- **Getting Started**: This section will provide a gentle introduction to the framework, including a quick-start guide, installation instructions, and a high-level overview of the key concepts.
- **Framework**: This section will provide detailed documentation for each component of the framework, including:
    - **Core Concepts**: An explanation of the fundamental principles and architecture of the framework.
    - **Modules**: Detailed documentation for each module, including its purpose, API, and usage examples.
    - **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials for common use cases.
- **Guides**: This section will provide practical guidance on how to use the framework to build secure, ethical, and compliant AI applications. It will include guides on:
    - **Security**: Best practices for securing AI applications.
    - **Ethics**: How to apply the ethical AI framework.
    - **Legal Compliance**: How to comply with relevant laws and regulations.
    - **Social Impact**: How to assess and mitigate the social impact of AI systems.
- **Community**: This section will provide resources for the community, including:
    - **Contributing**: How to contribute to the framework.
    - **Forums**: A link to the community forums.
    - **Blog**: A blog with articles and updates about the framework.
- **Glossary**: A glossary of key terms and definitions.

## 4. Content Style Guide

To ensure consistency, all content should adhere to the following style guide:

- **Headings**: Use Markdown headings to structure content.
- **Code Blocks**: Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for all code examples.
- **Images and Diagrams**: Use images and diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.
- **Links**: Use internal and external links to provide additional information.

## 5. Wiki Platform

We will use the built-in GitHub Wiki feature for our knowledge base. This will allow for easy integration with our code repository and a familiar experience for our developer community.
